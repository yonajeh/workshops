## Quick tips

> Official Pro Tips: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/pro-tips.html.

> CARET is the little blinking thing that you see when you type text.

> Learn default settings, try to avoid over customization.

> NoSQL has NoSupport.

> Do not version IDE specific files.

> In Idea placement of caret = context. And context will dictate what options will be available.

> Slow intelli-sense - SSD under heavy IO ?

> General caret moves work well: Cmd + Arrows, Shift + Cmd + Arrows, etc.

> The easiest way to learn Idea is by using : Tip of the day from Help menu

> Auto-curly braces in special blocks are added ad the end of the line or new line

1. When installing from scratch
