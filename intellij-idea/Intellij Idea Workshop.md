# IDEA Workshop

> Note for Mac users: Alt = Option ⌥ 

1. When installing from scratch
    - Please do not install all plugins, it'll transform your IDE into trash

## General default behaviour

1. Official Pro Tips: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/pro-tips.html.

1. CARET is the little blinking thing that you see when you type text.

1. Learn default settings, try to avoid over customization.

1. NoSQL has NoSupport.

1. Do not version IDE specific files.

1. In Idea placement of caret = context. And context will dictate what options will be available.

1. Slow intelli-sense - SSD under heavy IO ?

1. General caret moves work well: Cmd + Arrows, Shift + Cmd + Arrows, etc.

1. The easiest way to learn Idea is by using : Tip of the day from Help menu

1. Auto-curly braces in special blocks are added ad the end of the line or new line

1. Code completion supports Quick Doc

1. Sync settings and plugins : https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sharing-your-ide-settings.html
     - Jetbrains account
     - Git
     - Export / Import
